<!--PROPOSE A NEW CIP-->

<!--NOTE: 
You can leave these HTML comments in your PIP and delete the visible text guides, they will not appear and may be helpful to refer to if you edit your PIP again.-->

<!-- STEPS TO SUBMIT A PIP:
1. Complete the header above.
2. Fill in as much content as is appropriate for the status of your PIP.
3. Add Github labels for status, category, and type.-->

<!--ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR HEADER SECTION ABOVE-->

<!--<REMOVE>: Remove the <REMOVE> elements from above and below the header. Leave the --- characters.-->

<!--[cip]: Leave this section blank for new issues. Once you submit a PR later in the process, an editor will assign you a canonical number.-->

<!--[title]: Give your issue a concise, descriptive title prefixed by either its *type* for implementation PIPs or its category for other PIPs. (i.e. Core: Protocol Upgrade, etc.).-->

<!--[status]: Here is a description of status terms.
- `Idea`: an PIP issue that is incomplete.
- `Draft`: an PIP issue that is complete but undergoing rapid iteration and changes.
- `Stable`: an PIP issue that will not undergo fundemental changes and ready for final review by the community.
- `Pending`: an PIP that has been submitted as a PR or merged but not finalized.-->

<!--[category]: Here is a description of category terms.
- `Implementation`: an PIP that affects the network protocol's code bas.
- `Governance`: an PIP that affects the governance process for PIPs.
- `Informational`: an CIP that is merely for informational purposes but requires no action by the community, and will not be merged as a PIP.-->

<!--[type]: Here is a description of type terms. These are only applicable to PIPs in the *Implementation* category.
- `Core`: an PIP that affects the infra of PIN.
- `Interface`: an PIP that affects the PIN API/CLI.
- `RFC`: an PIP that proposes an general implementation standard (i.e. doctypes, document configurations, or document schemas).-->

<!--[requires]: A list of PIP(s) that this PIP depends on. *Optional.-->

<!--[replaces]: A list of PIP(s) that this PIP replaces. *Optional.-->

## Simple Summary
<!--Provide a simplified and layman-accessible explanation of the PIP.-->
Simple summary goes here.


## Abstract
<!--A short (~200 word) description of the technical issue being addressed.-->
Abstract goes here.


## Motivation
<!--Motivation is critical for PIPs that want to change the Public Index Network. It should clearly explain why the existing network protocol specification is inadequate to address the problem that the PIP solves. PIP submissions without sufficient motivation may be rejected outright.-->
Motivation goes here.


## Specification
<!--The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature.-->
Specification goes here.


## Rationale
<!--The rationale fleshes out the specification by describing what motivated the design and why particular design decisions were made. It should describe alternate designs that were considered and related work, e.g. how the feature is supported in other languages. The rationale may also provide evidence of consensus within the community, and should discuss important objections or concerns raised during discussion.-->
Rationale goes here.


## Backwards Compatibility
<!--All PIPs that introduce backwards incompatibilities must include a section describing these incompatibilities and their severity. The PIP must explain how the author proposes to deal with these incompatibilities. PIP submissions without a sufficient backwards compatibility section may be rejected outright.-->
Backwards compatibility goes here.


## Implementation
<!--The implementations must be completed before any PIP is given status "Final", but it need not be completed before the PIP is accepted.-->
Implementation goes here.


## Security Considerations
<!--All PIPs must contain a section that discusses the security implications/considerations relevant to the proposed change. Include information that might be important for security discussions, surfaces risks and can be used throughout the life cycle of the proposal. E.g. include security-relevant design
